        <h2>About Capstore</h2>
        <h3>Caps aren't just a form of headwear.</h3>
        <h3>Caps tell stories. Stories about us.</h3>
        <p>Our story started in Amsterdam. Living in the capital of the Netherlands, we noticed that caps are becoming more and more about telling a story. 
          A story about the person behind the cap. With this in mind, we started Capstore. A cap webshop where people can find, which resemble their story. We try to find and design caps, which relate to the culture of the urban lifestyle. Of course we'd love to hear and see about your story.
        </p>
        <p>Caps. Because we all have a story to tell.</p>
